### Problem Definition
Suzie Sneedler is a mathematician who is looking to outsource a programming solution for her calculation suite. She is requesting 3 separate python files, one for each of the following: A file called SquareNum that when run, will ask the user to input an integer, which the program will then square and return to the user. Another file called ProductNums that will ask the user for 2 integers which will then multiply them and return the product to the user. And finally, a file called SumNums that will ask the user for 2 integers before summing them and returning the result back to the user.
